            <h2>What do I do?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Junior at George Mason University majoring in Computer Science undergrad<br>
                <br>
                My main passion is technlogy and creating things with my keyboard. <br>
                I'm interested in software development and front-end development <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Why I created this website?</h3>
            <p>
                I read a book called The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy <br>
                and he stated that every top professional athlete in their <br>
                respected sport tracks every action that relates to their career. <br>
                Every meal, calories are counted, every work out, sets and time are recorded, <br>
                and every little thing that can be quantified is journaled. <br>
                <br>
                The point of all of this is to improve at their sport and <br>
                perform at their top levels. <br>
                <br>
                So this website is basically just that. Except I suck at cardio <br>
