        <h2>Who I am?</h2>
        <p>
            I am Computer Science undergrade currently in community college <br>
            and I just got accepted into GMU for my junior year. I start <br>
            this fall(: <br>
            <br>
            My main passion is technlogy and creating things with my mind. <br>
            No I'm not a super hero, at least not until I create something <br>
            great enough to benifit people's lives <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Why I created this website?</h3>
        <p>
            I read a book called The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy <br>
            and he stated that every top professional athlete in their <br>
            respected sport tracks every action that relates to their career; <br>
            Every meal, calories are counted, every work out, sets and time are recorded, <br>
            and every little thing that can be quantified is journaled. <br>
            <br>
            The point of all of this is to improve at their sport and <br>
            perform at their top levels. <br>
            <br>
            So this website is basically just that. Except I suck at cardio <br>
