                <p>IMPORTANT Note : You can do Step 1 or Step 2 in any order but I think<br>
                    doing it in this order to be the most streamlined way.<br>
                    Also you can skip step one and just get a free web hosting <br>
                    but you will have a website with a URL like <br>
                    Username.github.io which is fine but I personally don't think <br>
                    is as cool as having your own personalized URL <br>
                    <br>

                <h2>Step 1. Getting a Custom Domain</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to get a custom domain you actually need to own a domain.<br>
                    Which means paying money. But if you look in the right places you can <br>
                    find domain names for cheap <br>
                    <br>
                    I bough my domain for $8.88 a year which equates to about only<br>
                    three quarters every month. Which I can easily find digging inbetween <br>
                    my couch cushions<br>
                    <br>
                    If you search for a Domain prices at a company like <a href = "https://www.godaddy.com">goDaddy.com</a> that can buy<br>
                    from them at X price that doesn't mean you can ONLY buy it from godaddy <br>
                    <br>
                    Just think of domain providers as just brokers for facilitating a purchase<br>
                    like being able to buy the same appliance at Walmart or Amazon. <br>
                    <br>
                    Unless one company is offering you an extra service on top of a domain that <br>
                    you believe is worth a mark up in price than I would take the cheaper option <br>
                    <br>
                    For me when it came to finding the cheapest deals I went with <a href = "https://namecheap.com">namecheap</a> <br>
                    They also provide I really good whoIs protection so stuff like your personal <br>
                    address and phone number are kept off a public database at no extra cost<br>
                    <a href = "https://namecheap.com"><img src = "namecheaplogo.png"></a>
                </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <aside>
                <h3>What is <a href = "https://www.whois.com">whoIs.com</a></h3>
                <p>
                    WhoIs.com is a public database to find the person who registered a domain<br>
                    If you have a domain you like but is taken than you might be able to find <br>
                    the owners contact information on the whois.com database to try and send<br>
                    them an offer to purchase the domain<br>
                    <br>
                    But beware that once people smell an interest in a domain that they own<br>
                    they might ask for a ridiclous amount of money thinking they<br>
                    are holding onto the next <a href = "https://cats.com">cats.com</a><br>

            <h2>Step 2. Getting FREE web hosting</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Note: This only works for static pages as of right now. If you <br>
                        wish to host a dynamic website that you need to fork over a pretty penny<br>
                        Static DOES NOT mean you can't add responsive visual effects with CSS and Javascript<br>
                        Unless you're trying to build a live e-commerce store like Amazon or a social media <br>
                        webpage like Instagram than you don't need a dynamic page <br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Your going to need to have a github account which is free and easy to set up.<br>
                    Than your going to create a new repository and nameing it "yourusername.github.io"<br>
                    So if your username is emarino135 <br>
                    Than your repository name would look like:<br>
                    emarino135.github.io <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <img src = "githubwebpage.png"><br>
                    
                    Once that is done you go to your settings and pick a theme <br>
                    It really don't matter what theme <br>
                    I picked a hackerish looking terminal theme under Theme Chooser <br>
                    It's really just to initilze it and for you to test the website is working <br>
                    You can make your own theme later with some html css and javascript <br>
                    Also if you have a custom domain you can put it inside the Custom domain box <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    <img src = "githubsettings.png"><br>
                    
                    To set up the fully link the custom domain to git pages <br>
                    and to accept formats like "www." or "http" or "https" <br>
                    or whats called an apex domain like just "google.com" than <br>
                    you need to go to your domain providers website and go under advance DNS settings tab<br>
                    and input the IP addresses provided below. These are the address for github pages so it can <br>
                    properly find your webpage and display it <br>
                    <img src = "advancesdnssettings.png">
                    Keep in mind that sometimes this process is not instantanously <br>
                    From my experience I waited 30 mins for my custom domain to finally sync <br>
                    It was tempting to say github pages was broken and wasnt working <br>
                    and than suddenly I could find my website using my phone <br>
