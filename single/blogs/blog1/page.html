                <p>                    
                    It's currently on Spring break and every event is<br>
                    being cancled and travel warning are everywhere <br>
                    so here I am in my bedroom all break trying<br>
                    to become a better software developer by journaling<br>
                    my projects<br>
                    <br>
                    So far I've created a guideline for the <br>
                    file structure and oranization of my website<br>
                    I'm pretty content with how it is now. <br>
                    I just need to make sure the organization is scalable <br>
                    for the future. <br>
                    <br>
                    But in the visual department I haven't really added anything <br>
                    because I'm more focused on the getting the structure <br>
                    of my HTML right before I move on and start painting my <br>
                    webpage with sick CSS designs <br>
                    <br>
                    I can't wait till I can even include my <br>
                    JavaScript projects into the website to add <br>
                    an interactive element to my projects <br>
                    instead of just talking about them and showing <br>
                    off pictures <br>
                    <br>
                    Thanks for listening,<br>
                    <br>
                    study hard, <br>
                    <br>
                    peace
