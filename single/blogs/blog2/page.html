                <h1>First time using Python</h1>
                Created on: 3/24/2020
                <p>                    
                    Judging by my Downloads/python-3.7.7-amb64.exe downloaded on<br>
                    3/20/2020 so I've only been using Python for four days<br>
                    But because of my experience using Java and some experimentation with<br>
                    C#, and C++ learning Python's syntax was easy<br>
                    I love it and hate it<br>
                    It's like driving a manual car and switching to automatic<br>
                    But the thing I really love about Python and the reason that<br>
                    made me want to pick it up as another programming language <br>
                    is all the resources online for open source Python Modules<br>
                    <br>
                    Not only do they have such a great community online but<br>
                    the seamless install of external libraries with Pip is amazing<br>
                    also Pyinstall and creating a .exe is so much more rewarding and easier<br>
                    in my opinion than trying to create a Jar file with Java and trying to run it with a .batch<br>
                    I know not exactly the samething. I feel like perhaps it's because<br>
                    I haven't really familiarized myself too much with Maven so handling Jar<br>
                    files with Java on Visual Studio Code is kind of annoying<br>
                    I've been manually editing the .classpath and doing all sorts of weird stuff<br>
                    and the worse part is that when I try to export it it doesnt all end up in a little<br>
                    neat package where the end user can double click and run it like they would with any other <br>
                    application.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img src = "botInAction.png"><br>
                    Using Pyinstall with Python I was able to not only create a .exe file of my Python file but also<br>
                    include external libraries that I used and in this case another executable file which was for the <br>
                    Google Chrome<br>
                    I had to use chromedriver.exe along with my Python program that imported from Selenium so that I could<br>
                    open and control the webbrowser with my python script. <br>
                    <br>
                    I ran into some trouble when I was testing my bot.exe program on a clean windows pc that didn't have any<br>
                    python language or anything dev related already installed<br>
                    Because it didn't already have chromedriver.exe installed on the computer the bot.exe wouldn't run<br>
                    So I included chromedriver.exe inside the bot.exe so the program and all its modules and classes were <br>
                    located in one place so when the user clicks on the bot.exe the python script has all the necessary components<br>
                    to run. And the best part is the user doesn't even need to have python installed on their PC because of the way <br>
                    Pyinstall turn the python script into a .exe<br>
                    <br>
                    The only thing the end user has to make sure is correct is that their computer can run a .exe file and that <br>
                    they are running the latest version of Chrome. <br>
                    <br>
                    This is what happens when the user clicks on the exe file. The bot opens up the terminal which<br>
                    is optional but I'm keeping for now so I can check for any errors<br>
                    Than it open the browser and goes to the location of the game <a href = "http://civclicker.sourceforge.net/civclicker/civclicker.html">CivClicker</a><br>
                    And begins to gather Food, Cut Wood, and Mine Stone. If it ever reaches <br>
                    max capacity for the resources storage levels than it will go to the build menu<br>
                    and buy more storage for the given resource<br>
                    <img src = "botBuilding.png"><br>
                    I did create some methods for getting other upgrades<br>
                    but I'm still familirazing myself with python so my level of code organization<br>
                    isn't as great as it is with Java so I'm trying to learn two things at once<br>
                    <br>
                    Right now my bot atleast collects resources and can build and move to different menus.<br>
                    So adding the rest of the buildings shouldn't be to challenging<br>
                    What is a bug that I have noticed is that in order for the Python script to click on an element<br>
                    It need to be somewhat in range of the current window<br>
                    So if I scroll to the bottom of the page and force to script to stay down at bottom<br>
                    while it's trying to zoom back up to see the element what will happen is that bot will hit<br>
                    an error and the bot will come to a stop<br>
                    I just need to find out the exact error and figure out a way to let the program continue<br>
                    Perhaps a "try and except" where I can just run a thread(few seconds) until the <br>
                    user stops pulling on the screen and than the bot can continue<br>
                    <br>
                    Another thing that bothers me is that the bot only starts a new session of the game<br>
                    there is no way for the User to currently load a pre existing save file and have the bot<br>
                    increase their already existing civilization<br>
                    This is because selenium initiates a version of Chrome that is similar to incognito<br>
                    The version of Chrome that is launched has no cookies from the user profile<br>
                    <br>
                    Because the save files for the game are saved through cookies I would need<br>
                    to find away to prompt the user to enter the Path to their Chrome Profile so I can<br>
                    access the cookie data and read/write the website save file to/from their main Chrome Profile<br>
                    So that way the next time they start the bot the bot will still be working on their<br>
                    previous civilization without loss of progress<br>
                    <br>
                    Another aspect of the game that I have yet to implement is the recruitment of workers<br>
                    at first I wanted the bot to do all the work but if the bot is really going to play the game<br>
                    than it should play it in the most optimal way I can possibly design it. In the game when you create <br>
                    workers they can produce resources at a x per seconds rate and this rate is only refreshed by the Javascript<br>
                    every fraction of a second<br>
                    I could have the bot mercelessly continue to spam collect resources but the result would be slower<br>
                    over time because it would be like doing 1 + 1 + 1 1000X times a second vs having the bot create workers that<br>
                    can generater 10_000 food per second and it ends up being less resource heavy for the computer and <br>
                    actually appears faster to the end user because it isn't slowing down the browser<br>
                    Also at some point the workers will be making more resources than the bots because given enough time<br>
                    they can be making over 10K+ in resources per second meanwhile I calculate that my bots at top<br>
                    PC efficiency are only opperating at about 20-30 sources per second (each resources) it's definently<br>
                    a different rate depanding on the PC (2009 HP Pavilion) <br>
                    <br>
                    My first "bot" attempt if I can even call it that was by using a Python Script that listened for a <br>
                    keyboard press on a particular letter and would than spam click the left mouse button until I clicked<br>
                    that same keyboard key to pause it<br>
                    This actually didn't result in much faster production that the workers because again the website was only<br>
                    able to refresh the values at such a slow rate that spam clicking resources would be a waste of time<br>
                    That time clicking the elements for collecting resources could better be spent on also hiring workers<br>
                    which would compound the earning for my civilisation as I'll constantly be investing in them over time<br>
                    <br>
                    My far future plans for this bot is to run multiple instances of the bot and have it learn from previous playthroughs<br>
                    so that it can record the amount of time for it's civlization to progress to a particular level and<br>
                    find out which is the most optimal way to play the game to reach that point. But to really make it fair<br>
                    I think the bots would have to be capped at a certain clicks per second so that differences in machine hardware<br>
                    can be accounted for and strategies can be properly weighed <br>
                    <br>
                    Basically if you can only click 1 click per second what is that most optimal way to advance your civilization<br>
                    to a certain point<br>
                    <br>
                    Thanks for listening,<br>
                    <br>
                    peace.<br>
                    <br>
                    ps next time I will record a video and post it to youtube I can embed it in my website so you can watch<br>
                    it here like a demonstration of my bot in action.<br>
