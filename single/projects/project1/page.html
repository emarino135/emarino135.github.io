            <h1>What I used:</h1>
            <p>
                Editor: 
                Visual Studio Code (I use my own custom theme I shared on github)<br>
                Language: Java <br>
                Libraries: <br>
                Swing (javax.swing.*) used for the visual GUI<br>
                AWT (awt.event.*) used to add action listeners to Swing components <br>
            </p>
            <h1>Useful Tips</h1>
            <p>
                If you're going to be following along here<br>
                are some useful tips that will make development time much shorter<br>
                <br>
                Replace function<br>
                CTRL + H <br>
                I used to change the X's to O's and the true's to false really fast<br>
                <br>
                Duplicate Current Line<br>
                SHIFT + ALT + DOWN/UP ARROW<br>
                It speeds up the process like crazy instead of always having<br>
                to do copy and paste manually with your mouse<br>
            </p>
            <h1>Drafting</h1>
            <p>
                So for this project we're only really going to need two classes<br>
                I put my actionlistener class in it's own folder because <br>
                since I use annonymous classes I don't like having them mixed<br>
                with other class files<br>
                <br>
                First class is named Run.java which holds the main method<br>
                it also holds the following methods <br>
                Replay(): Decides whether to restart the board<br>
                or to close the window <br>
                clearBoard(): Cleans the tiktactoe board of previous x's and o's<br>
                buildBoard(): used to initiated all JComponents and set their <br>
                basic visual properties and behavior <br>
                The behavior will be handled by calling the constructor <br>
                for the Mark class which we will be getting to soon<br>
                oTurn(): Used to decide who's turn it is. Decides based <br>
                on the number of X's and O's already on the board <br>
                gamePlaying(): returns true if no win/draw condition is met<br>
                this is used to create a infinite while loop so the game is kept playing<br>
                until a win/draw condition is met <br>
                <br>
                The second class is named Mark.java<br>
                It's purpose it simply to just mark down x or o depending on<br>
                what oTurn decides. False means it's not o's turn so it's x's turn<br>
                true means it is indeed o's turn<br>
                Inside the mark class there is the following methods<br>
                <br>
                setOTurn(boolean turnO): used to set the variable OTurn <br>
                than we have the constructor <br>
                Mark(JButton b): it takes a given JButton and gives it an action listener<br>
                This action listener see's if the button's text is already marked<br>
                if the text is equal to "" meaning it's blank than we write to the text <br>
                an "O" if turnO is true. Else we write "X". Because if it's not clear <br>
                and it's currently no O's turn that must be it has to be marked with "X"<br>
                <br>
                The reason we can't use a variable inside or a comparable is because <br>
                we cannot have an actionlistener that alters that value of an outside<br>
                variable so can't use it to change turns. That was my first attempt <br>
                and I just couldn't get that method to work so instead the oTurn was <br>
                calculated by seeing how many X's and O's are currently written down<br>
                and than calculating it from there<br>
            </p>
                <h1>My Thought Process</h1>
            <p>
                I finished this code today and will go through my process of thinking<br>
                while creating it and will provide the full code through my github down below<br>
                <a href = "https://github.com/emarino135/Mini_Projects_2020/tree/master/TicTacToe">Click here</a><br>
                <br>
                The first thing I did was create the Run.java and initiate all the <br>
                JComponents. The logic behind naming my buttons b1-b9 was because <br>
                I wanted to buttons to be ordered in the same way a standard NUMPAD is<br>
                on keyboard<br>
                <br>
                7 8 9<br>
                4 5 6<br>
                1 2 3<br>
                <br>
                I just felt it would give the names more meaning when it came to their<br>
                positioning.<br>
                Than I just made a main method that call the constructor for the run class<br>
                than I created the Run constructor with a buildBoard since I planned on <br>
                initiating the GUI right away to make sure it's visually working <br>
                <br>
                Build board was pretty simple by just initiating componnents setting<br>
                JFrame Settings than adding components to JFrame and setting JButton bounds<br>
                <br>
                I than wanted to add JButton behavior but didn't want to create <br>
                an ActionListener for each button so instead I created a separate class<br>
                called Mark.java and inside that class I gave it the actionListener for <br>
                writing the JButton text. <br>
                So that way when you click on the spot on the TicTacToe board it would mark<br>
                it X or O<br>
                But at this point it would only mark X so I need to figure out how to add turns<br>
                In order to do that I need to count all the X's and O's currently on the board<br>
                <br>
                So I created a method called oturn(): with two local variables <br>
                called countX and countO and checked if each JButtons text was equal<br>
                to "X" or "O" and than increment the according counting variable<br>
                <br>
                After all buttons were counter for X or O I had to decide who's turn it was<br>
                Since X always starts first in a game I checked if countX was greater than countO<br>
                if the amount of x's is greater that means that x has already went so it's o's turn<br>
                if that's false than it must be X's turn to go.
                <br>
                But in order to change the way the ActionListener marks an X or an O I had<br>
                to set the class Mark's OTurn with a setter that I created within the Mark class<br>
                <br>
                The setter would than change oTurn which would than change whether the actionListener<br>
                Marked the JButton with an X or O accordingly<br>
                <br>
                OOPS<br>
                At this point I didn't plan ahead to initiate the Mark constructor with each JButton<br>
                So I simply created a Mark object and passed a JButton into it's constructor. <br>
                I could have made an actionListener for each JButton but that would have create <br>
                NINE SEPERATE ANNONYMOUS CLASSES!!!<br>
                Which is just ridiculous and bothers be because I just don't like the way <br>
                Anonymous classes look inside a directory<br>
                Also they make it annonying if you want to create a JAR exectuable file for <br>|
                your java program<br>
                Just a lot more typing and a lot more pain<br>
                <br>
                So since I was running everything inside the constructor for the Run class<br>
                using a while(true) loop I need to eventually bring the game to a stop <br>
                once a game was finished<br>
                So I Created a method called gamePlaying() which checks<br>
                if the game has met a win condition or a draw condition<br>
                If neither is met than that means the game is still being played<br>
                Few minutes later after a bunch of if statements for each win condition<br>
                each returning false meaning the game has been met<br>
                If none have been met than true is returned<br>
                <br>
                Now the game was working and would play for one game<br>
                After that the board would still be there but nothing would happen<br>
                You could continue to add X's and O's depending on who's turn it was last<br>
                But the game wouldn't reset or anything<br>
                So I just made a clearBoard() function to clear the board after the game was being played<br>
                and nested everything inside yet another while loop so the reset would occur after<br>
                the while(gamePlaying()) loop remained true<br>
                <br>
                Now there was another problem<br>
                The game would reset before immediently after someone won<br>
                without even providing feedback for who won<br>
                So suddently the board was blank and USER would be left<br>
                wondering why the board clear<br>
                <br>
                So I wanted to create a message that could be displayed <br>
                to the user to let them know who had won or if it was a draw <br>
                But I also wanted users to have the option to stop playing by <br>
                clicking a second option for NO <br>
                <br>
                So now I created a new method called Replay() <br>
                looking back I should have called it Rematch<br>
                That would have made more sense but it still <br>
                gives the same idea I think <br>
                In this method it would close the application if the user<br>
                said no to having a rematch/replaying the game<br>
                but if the user said yes <br>
                than the game would clearBoard() and start all over again in a<br>
                while(true) infinite loop<br>
                <br>
                for the Replay() method I created a local integer variable <br>
                called reply (I KNOW TYPO) and gave it the value of<br>
                JOptionPane.showCOnfirmDialog(null,message,"Replay",JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION)<br>
                so reply could only equal 1 or 0. The message would be a class String variable<br>
                inside the gamePlaying method I added a "message =" so depending the win/draw <br>
                condition this next prompt would than show the correct message like<br>
                <br>
                "X WON! REMATCH?"
                <br>
                Killing two birds with one stone. <br>
                1. Giving the user feedback for who won<br>
                2. Giving the user the option to reset the board or<br>
                close out of the application by saying no<br>
                <br>
                If the user did say NO than a System.exit(0) would be trigger<br>
                Terminating the program entirely.<br>
                <br>
                If they said yes than the while(true) loop in the Run Constructor would<br>
                continue playing the game forever and forever reseting the game<br>
                for as long as the User keeps pressing Yes to rematch<br>
                <br>
                And that concludes by TicTacToe with Swing GUI project<br>
                <br>

                I will keep trying to make my code as assessible <br>
                as possible to other programmers <br>
                <br>
                But hopefully my thought processes can provide some insight<br>
